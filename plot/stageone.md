# Stage One : inside hikky's room (doubles as tutorial_

(hikky plays the computer, sfx : typing sounds)

(lights go off, sfx : idk fam)

Hikky : ah dammit, must've been the switch again...

(gets off the chair, starts to walk around the room)

(grabs a flashlight from the table) 

Hikky : i really should start to seriously pack up for the move

Hikky : but the event is still ongoing, i can't waste my time doing useless things....

(jumps over a box)

(moves a box -the box is near to the door, so he has to move it away from the door-, then jumps over it)

(opens door, move to the next level)
