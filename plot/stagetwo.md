#Stage Two : outside hikky's room, inside the house 

Hikky : Do i really have to get out of my room? 

Hikky : ......

Hikky : No one's home, not like i have any other options

(hikky continues walking)

(sees a cat sleeping, illuminated by the moonlight) 

Hikky : I should be careful not to wake him up

/press s to crouch/

Hikky : .....

Hikky : Maybe it doesn't matter.

(( Hikky doesn't crouch, cat attacks and hikky has to start the level over, also increases death count by one. If Hikky crouches while moving over the cat, the game continues))

(sees a sofa veiled, jumps over sofa)

(push one box to climb over it, in order to jump over the two boxes stack on top of each other)

(if player jumps instead of going straight down, hikky will hit the chandelier. Hikky : "sh#t" 

(keeps walking)

(sees the token listrik thing, interact)

Hikky : Ah, damn. We're out of voltage. It really is a blackout.

Hikky : /sigh/

Hikky : I guess i really have to go to a minimart

Hikky : Such a bother

(move to the next level)
